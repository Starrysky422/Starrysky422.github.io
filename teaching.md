<font size="3">
<i>Calculus Practice I</i> is a problem-solving course for first-year students in science and engineering at Seoul National University. As a teaching assistant, I delivered a two-hour lecture each week, designed and administered four quizzes, and held regular office hours to provide personalized help for struggling students. My efforts were reflected in my TA evaluation, where I earned a near-perfect score of 33/35, highlighting my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively.

<font size="3">
I designed and conducted an 8-lecture course titled <i>Introduction to Category Theory</i> as part of the 2024 Winter Mentoring Program in the College of Natural Sciences, Seoul National University. The course aimed to reexamine undergraduate mathematics from the viewpoint of category theory, thereby fostering students' mathematical maturity and categorical insight, while introducing fundamental concepts of homological algebra. To enhance the learning experience, I created a problem set, allowing students to appreciate the elegance and depth of mathematical structures.

### <b>Lecturer, <i>Introduction to Mathematical Analysis I</i></b>
- Winter 2022
{: style="font-size: 0.83rem; line-height:2"}

<font size="3">
<i>Introduction to Mathematical Analysis I</i> is a core mathematics course at Seoul National University that focuses on differentiation, integration, and the point set topology of the real numbers and function spaces. As a mentor of the 2022 Winter Major Tutoring School in the College of Natural Sciences, I designed and conducted a 9-lecture series that provided a comprehensive and structured overview of the course's foundational concepts. To ensure uniform accessibility, I actively utilized visual diagrams and relatable examples.
