Hi, my name is Younghun Jo.

As of December 2022, I'm a third-year undergraduate student at Seoul National University studying mathematics, currently taking two years off due to the mandatory military service in Korean Army.

I presently have no specific interest. (In other words, interested in various topics!) Meanwhile, I'm studying probability theory and algebraic number theory now.
