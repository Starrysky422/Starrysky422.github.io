Hi, my name is Younghun Jo.

As of December 2024, I'm a senior undergraduate student at Seoul National University studying mathematics.

My primary focus is on probability theory. Additionally, I have a broad interest in various other mathematical topics, including arithmetic dynamics and ergodic theory.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CV_Younghun Jo.pdf). (Last updated on December 14, 2024)
