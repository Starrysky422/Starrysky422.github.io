In March 2024, I gave a talk at Peer Mathematics Seminar, a weekly peer seminar held in Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University. I introduced the local–global principle for periodic orbits of polynomial maps on affine spaces over Dedekind domains, and the uniform boundedness of the periodic orbit size. The talk was based on Pezda's [result](https://eudml.org/doc/278142) in 2003.
