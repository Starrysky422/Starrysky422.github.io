In January 2024, I gave a talk at Peer Mathematics Seminar, a weekly peer seminar held in Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University. I introduced the isomorphism established by J. Milnor and J. H. Silverman between the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_2$ of quadratic rational maps and the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$.
