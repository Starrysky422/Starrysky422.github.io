In June 2024, I gave a talk at the [Reading Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/snuprob/seminar/reading-seminar?authuser=0) of the [SNU Probability Group](https://sites.google.com/view/snuprob/home?authuser=0). I introduced the current state of knowledge regarding the metastability of contact processes on finite graphs. In particular, I discussed precise estimates of the mean extinction time for specific cases.
