In February 2024, I gave a talk at Peer Mathematics Seminar, a weekly peer seminar held in Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University. I introduced the concept of determinantal point processes and discussed their characterization as mixtures of determinantal projection processes. This material originated from my final survey report for the course *Topics in Random Matrix Theory* in the Fall semester of 2023.
