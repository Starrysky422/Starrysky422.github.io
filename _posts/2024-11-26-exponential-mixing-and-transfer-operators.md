In November 2024, I gave a talk at the final presentation session for the course *Topics in Topology (Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory)* by [Prof. Seonhee Lim](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~lim/). I introduced the transfer operator framework for establishing the exponential mixing properties of dynamical systems. In particular, I covered proofs of exponential mixing of one-dimensional expanding maps, and geodesic flows on compact surfaces of variable negative curvature. The talk was based on Pollicott's lecture notes [4].


## Abstract
Transfer operators offer a powerful framework for establishing the exponential mixing properties of dynamical systems and, in certain cases, provide the only available approach. In this talk, we explore the methodology for proving exponential mixing through the spectral analysis of transfer operators, highlighting the key concepts and techniques involved.
