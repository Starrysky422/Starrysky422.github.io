In July 2024, I gave a short talk at the [13th Cornell Probability Summer School](https://math.cornell.edu/13th-cornell-probability-summer-school). I briefly introduced the current state of knowledge regarding the metastability of contact processes on finite graphs. In particular, I discussed precise estimates of the mean extinction time for specific cases, and presented the main result of my paper that can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09501).
