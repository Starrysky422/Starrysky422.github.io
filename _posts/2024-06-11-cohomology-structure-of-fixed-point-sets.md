In June 2024, I gave a talk at the final presentation session for the course *Algebraic Topology II* by [Prof. Seonhee Lim](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~lim/). I introduced the relationship between the cohomology structures of a space and that of the fixed point set of a $\ZZ_p$ or $S^1$-action on the space. In particular, I covered the Borel construction, the Leray–Hirsch theorem, and the inheritance of the Poincaré duality property. The talk was based on Sections VII.1 and VII.6 of Bredon's textbook [1].
