In October 2024, I gave a talk at Peer Mathematics Seminar, a weekly peer seminar held in Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University. I discussed the construction of the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model and the Parisi formula, and addressed the open problems involving the phase transition observed through the free energy. The contents of this talk were based on Prof. Antonio Auffinger's lectures at 13th Cornell Probability Summer School.


## Abstract
In recent decades, the study of spin glass models has enabled purely mathematical formulation of real-world phenomena and physical predictions for disordered systems, providing many intriguing results and significant questions in probability theory. In this talk, we will discuss the construction of the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model and the Parisi formula, and address open problems related to the phase transition observed through the free energy.
