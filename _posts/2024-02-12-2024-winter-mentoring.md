During this winter vacation, I conducted a 8-lecture course *Introduction to Category Theory* as a part of the 2024 Winter Mentoring program in the College of Natural Sciences, Seoul National University. The objective of the course was to offer a category theoretic viewpoint on undergraduate mathematics, and to introduce basic concepts of homological algebra. I also created a problem set as a supplementary material for the course.

## Syllabus
### Course Description
Many branches of mathematics define certain types of *objects*, and study *morphisms* between them. Examples include vector spaces and linear transformations for linear algebra, groups and homomorphisms for group theory, and topological spaces and continuous maps for point-set topology. Category theory formalizes these mathematical structures as *categories*, and study relationships between them through *functors*, thereby revealing their omni-disciplinary properties and fundamental characteristics.

Undergraduate mathematics students may have encountered glimpses of category theory in their coursework. Have you ever noticed a sense of uniformity across various fields? When do we consider two types of instances to be *the same*? In what contexts do we use descriptors like *universal*, *natural*, and *free* used? This course seeks to address students' curiosity about these questions.

The aim of this course is to reexamine undergraduate mathematics from the viewpoint of category theory, thereby enhancing students' mathematical maturity and categorical insight. In the first half of the course, we introduce concepts of category theory and explore their interconnections. In the second half, we provide a rigorous treatment of homology and cohomology from a categorical perspective. Rather than delving deeply into theory, the focus is on providing various examples encountered in undergraduate mathematics.

While no specific theoretical prerequisites are required, students are encouraged to have taken courses such as *Linear Algebra*, *Modern Algebra*, and *Introduction to Topology* to understand the diverse examples discussed in the class.

### Course Meeting Times
2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session
