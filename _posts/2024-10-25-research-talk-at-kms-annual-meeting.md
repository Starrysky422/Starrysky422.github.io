In October 2024, I gave an [invited talk](https://www.kms.or.kr/conference/abstract/search_view.html?num=9325&uid=88) at the [2024 KMS Annual Meeting](https://www.kms.or.kr/conference/2024_fall/). I presented a precise estimate for the mean extinction time of the contact process with a fixed infection rate on a star graph. The talk was based on my research advised by [Prof. Insuk Seo](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~insuk.seo/), and the preprint of my paper can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09501).
