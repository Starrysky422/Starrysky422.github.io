In January 2024, I gave a talk at [WDC](https://sites.google.com/view/wdc2024/home?authuser=0), a peer conference on diverse topics in mathematics. I introduced the problem of establishing equality between the field of moduli and a field of definition for a dynamical system on $\mathbb{P}^1$, and the resolution of J. H. Silverman, involving concepts from various mathematical domains.


## Abstract
The dynamics of rational maps on $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a central focus in the theory of arithmetic dynamics. In this talk, we address the problem of establishing equality between the field of moduli and a field of definition for a dynamical system on $\mathbb{P}^1$. The approach to this problem incorporates a range of terminology from various mathematical domains, including Galois cohomology, algebraic curves, and finite subgroups of the projective linear group. This exploration is based on Silverman's [result](http://www.numdam.org/item/?id=CM_1995__98_3_269_0) in 1995.
