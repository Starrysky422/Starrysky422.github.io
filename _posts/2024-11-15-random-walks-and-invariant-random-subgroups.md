In November 2024, I gave a talk at the Seoul National University Dynamics Seminar, supervised by [Prof. Seonhee Lim](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~lim/). I introduced basic concepts related to random walks on groups, the notion of invariant random subgroups, and generalizations of the tools for random walks on groups to random coset spaces.


## Abstract
Upon first introduced by Kesten in 1959, the study of random walks on groups has proven to be a valuable method for investigating group structures, giving rise to many intriguing questions. Meanwhile, invariant random subgroups have emerged as central objects in the study of group actions, serving as natural generalizations of normal subgroups and lattices. 
In the first part of this talk, we will introduce fundamental concepts related to random walks on groups, including the Poisson–Furstenberg boundary and Avez asymptotic entropy. In the second part, we will present the notion of invariant random subgroups and discuss related results. Finally, we will address generalizations of former results on random walks on groups, extending them to random coset spaces, which are quotients by invariant random subgroups.
